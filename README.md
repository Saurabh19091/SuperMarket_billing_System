The Super Market Billing System is a C++-based project that simulates a billing system for a supermarket. The system allows users to add items to a bill, calculate the total amount, and apply various discounts to get the final amount.

Features:

Item Management: Users can add items to the bill, specifying the item name, rate, and quantity.
Bill Calculation: The system calculates the total amount of the bill based on the items added.
Discount Options: The system provides four discount options:
No discount
Flat discount (e.g., $50 off)
Percentage discount (e.g., 10% off)
Coupon discount (using a predefined coupon code)
Coupon Management: The system stores coupon codes and their corresponding discount percentages.
User Interface: The system provides a simple text-based interface for users to interact with the system.
How it Works:

The user is presented with a menu to add items, print the bill, or exit the system.
When adding an item, the user is prompted to enter the item name, rate, and quantity.
The system stores the item details in a file and displays a success message.
When printing the bill, the system reads the item details from the file, calculates the total amount, and applies the chosen discount.
The system displays the final amount after discount and a thank-you message.
Benefits:

Easy to use: The system provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to manage their bills.
Flexible discount options: The system offers various discount options to cater to different customer needs.
Accurate calculations: The system ensures accurate calculations of the total amount and discount amounts.
Potential Applications:

Supermarkets: This system can be used in supermarkets to manage customer bills and apply discounts.
Retail stores: The system can be adapted for use in retail stores to manage sales and discounts.
Online shopping platforms: The system can be integrated into online shopping platforms to provide a seamless billing experience for customers.
